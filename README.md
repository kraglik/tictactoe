# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game implementation with tree-search based ai.

At first, I used a minimax algorithm, but then I remembered about Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search.
It is simple and much more intuitive, in my opinion.

But we don't need any random here, we can just observe all possible states to find the best one.
I've limited search depth to 5 moves, but you can play with it.
